3. Try log out from your computer :)

Note that this software uses scheduled tasks to run during startup. If you move the software, you have to do uninstall then install again. Also, it will not run with battery power, in order to change that you have to [disable only run in AC power by yourself](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9075564/change-settings-for-power-for-windows-scheduled-task).

To uninstall just run `uninstall.bat`.

The program should not be detected as a virus anymore, as it does no longer contain compiled VB code. Check [this Virustotal scan](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c4d0e098ca71db2645097d6535b41835e1ed09184bd608d4a326f42f6e3de775?nocache=1) from the [latest update](/willnode/autobloom/pull/16).
